                <h2 className="text-md font-bold">4. Legal Bases (EU/EEA/UK/Switzerland)</h2>
                <p>
                    Where required by applicable law, we rely on one or more of the following legal bases:
                    (I) performance of a contract (providing the service), (II) legitimate interests (app security,
                    product improvement), (III) consent (where requested), and (IV) compliance with legal obligations.
                </p>

                <h2 className="text-md font-bold">5. Cookies</h2>
                <p>
                    We use essential cookies to keep you logged in and operate the app. We may also use optional cookies
                    (e.g., analytics) to understand usage. You can control cookies in your browser settings and—where required—
                    via in‑app consent controls.
                </p>
                <br />
                <h2 className="text-md font-bold">6. Analytics and Third Parties</h2>
                <p>
                    We may use third‑party service providers (e.g., analytics, error reporting, hosting). These providers act
                    as processors and may handle limited personal data on our behalf and under our instructions.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We do not sell your personal data.

                <h2 className="text-md font-bold">7. International Transfers</h2>
                <p>
                    Your data may be processed in countries other than your own. Where required, we implement appropriate
                    safeguards (e.g., standard contractual clauses) to protect your information.
                </p>
                <br />
                <h2 className="text-md font-bold">8. Data Retention</h2>
                <p>
                    We keep personal data only as long as necessary for the purposes described above, unless a longer retention
                    period is required by law. When no longer needed, we delete or anonymize the data.
                </p>
                <br />
                <h2 className="text-md font-bold">9. Security</h2>
                <p>

                    over the internet or electronic storage is 100% secure.
